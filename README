Crapper is a poorly-named cron wrapper.

Crapper was written to solve three problems:

* Job stacking

To prevent multiple overlapping runs of the same job crapper will
create a lockfile for each job. These files are given a name which 
matches that given to the job itself. To prevent inadvertent re-use
of names (and an attempted sharing of a lockfile path), each name is
'registered' on first use by creating a file containing the command. 
Executions will fail if they are passed without a name or with a name 
that's already registered with a differing command (crapper's other
arguments may be changed without re-registration)

The --deregister option may be used to remove this file (and so forget
the job existed) which will be necessary on the first run after 
modifying a job. It does not prevent the eventual execution of the 
job; you can pass this option in the crontab if you wish to circumvent
this registration process. 

* Logging & stdout/stderr

Cron is quite poor at logging what's going on; crapper logs its own
operations quite verbosely, and currently only a few more details about
the job itself than does normal cron. 

Crapper also, by default, discards text printed to stdout and leaves
stderr be; you can have stdout left alone by passing --stdout, or 
have it printed to a file by giving --stdout an argument.

* Conditional running

Sometimes you only want to run one command if another exits sucessfully; 
resulting in commands chained together with &&s; if the --preflight 
switch is set, crapper will only run if its argument returns true.


Some examples:

Restart some daemon nightly with stderr emailed, with nothing emailed and
with both emailed:

 crapper -c "/etc/init.d/mydaemon restart" --name daemonrestart
 crapper -c "/etc/init.d/mydaemon restart 2>&1" --name daemonrestart
 crapper -c "/etc/init.d/mydaemon restart" --name daemonrestart --stdout

Once it's run once (and registered) you need no longer supply the command:

 crapper --name daemonrestart

You might only wish to restart it if it's already running:

 crapper --preflight "pgrep daemon" --name daemonrestart

Or do it awfully slowly:

 crapper --nice 19 --ionice 3 --name daemonrestart --preflight "pgrep daemon"
